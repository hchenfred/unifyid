  * run 'npm run react-dev'
  * run 'npm run server-dev'

## Features
  * See a list of their usernames and the websites associated with them.
  * Delete credentials from the list.
  * Share credentials with other users, given their UnifyID username.
  * See "shared" credentials that other people have shared with the user.

## Things to be improved?
  * use Redux to manage states
  * currently, the borrower_id is not stored in an array. It means that one credential can only have one borrower.
